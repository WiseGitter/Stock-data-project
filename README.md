# Stock-data-project
In this project, I have created a database by extracting the stock data of listed stocks such as Tesla(TSLA) and GameStop(GME), in order to analyse its historical data such as Quarterly Revenue. This project was a part of my IBM Data Science professional Certification.
The dashboard gives us a clear understanding of the KPIs. I used Webscrapping method to extract relevant informations for the analysis from certain websites like macrotrends.net . I used plotly for data visualisation in fot this project
